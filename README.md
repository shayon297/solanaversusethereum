- **Direct links** to data sources for verification

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Scroll through the metrics to compare Solana and Ethereum performance
3. Click on data source links to view the original data

## Technical Stack

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** with responsive design
- **JavaScript** with Chart.js for interactive charts
- **Chart.js** for data visualization

## Data Sources

The website includes sample data for demonstration. To connect real data, you would need to:

1. Set up API connections to the data sources
2. Replace the sample data generators with actual API calls
3. Implement data refresh functionality

## File Structure
